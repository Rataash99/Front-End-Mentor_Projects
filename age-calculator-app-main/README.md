## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned so many things while working on this project,
working with Js date function and I am getting stronger in using Js.

### Continued development

I am looking forward to learn more concepts, we learn something new from every new project so I am planning to make more projects and most probably using react and with the help of css frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com) - They have got so much knowledge about many programming languages. It's a great resource for learning and they also provide you to practically implement concept knowledge by yourself, great resource.
- [Javatpoint](https://www.javatpoint.com/calculate-age-using-javascript) - This article helped to learn more about javascript's Date function and to acheive what's need to be done in the given project.

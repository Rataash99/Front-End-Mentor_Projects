### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's been about 3 months since I've done any web project and I did it just to recall whatever I've forgotten over these months.

### Continued development

About 3 months ago I completed a REACT project and REACT framework is amazing and I am planning to build more projects using same. 
Also tailwind CSS also facinated me so I'll keep using that too.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) - This helps me selecting the desired font for my web App. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Netlify Web App](https://www.netlify.com) - If you want to deploy your practice projects or projects that are not production ready Netlify is to go to website for that.

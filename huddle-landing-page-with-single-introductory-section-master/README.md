### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - This helps me selecting the desired font for my web App. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Netlify Web App](https://www.example.com) - If you want to deploy your practice projects or projects that are not production ready Netlify is to go to website for that.

- [Font Awesome](https://www.fontawesome.com) - If you want to use icons for your website fontawesome is the way to go they have got plenty of good icons, must check out.

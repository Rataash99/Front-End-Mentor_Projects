## My process


### What I learned

CSS animations

### Continued development

I am looking forward to learn more concepts, we learn something new from every new project so I am planning to make more projects and most probably using react and with the help of css frameworks.

### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com) - They have got so much knowledge about many programming languages. It's a great resource for learning and they also provide you to practically implement concept knowledge by yourself, great resource.
